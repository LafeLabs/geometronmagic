# Trash Robot Space

Our mission is to create a civilization from just trash and things we can grow.  We aim to use the fantastic wealth of minerals mined from the last 300 years in closed loop cycles, and to immediately cease all global mining and other extraction industries(coal, oil, gas, etc).  When we can, we use organic materials which we can compost and regrow locally in our neighborhoods.  We call this new civilization Trash Magic.

To build Trash Magic, we start by building machines which print symbols onto trash, converting trash into a form of media.  Using the purely geometric programming language of [Geometron](scrolls/geometron) we are able to build machines which are easy to program and redesign without any special technical skills.

We distribute these media in public spaces, and recruit creators to join us in the Trash Robot Space to 

We produce self-replicating media from trash.  We use the language of Geometron to program robots made from trash to print into trash.  We consume cardbard waste, plastic waste, electronics waste,
