# Trash Robot Space

Our mission is to create a civilization from just trash and things we can grow.  We aim to use the fantastic wealth of minerals mined from the last 300 years in closed loop cycles, and to immediately cease all global mining and other extraction industries(coal, oil, gas, etc).  When we can, we use organic materials which we can compost and regrow locally in our neighborhoods.  We will make this possible with self-replicating media which uses the Internet to instantly replicate the technology across the world as it grows.

To build Trash Magic, we start by building machines which print symbols onto trash, converting trash into a form of media.  Using the purely geometric programming language of [Geometron](scrolls/geometron) we are able to build machines which are easy to program and redesign without any special technical skills.  All of our software works in a Web Browser and is hosted on our free and open Geometron Servers.

We distribute these media in public spaces, and invite creators to join us in the Trash Robot Space to create more media, share their own media, and build more machines.  This flow of information through physical media is like any other media system in that it can be used to distribute what people want to: ideas, connections, brands, movements, methods, groups, stories, music, art, software, articles, videos, machines, food, clothes, structural elements, medicine, and so on.
