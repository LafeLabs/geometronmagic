# Solar Power Station

This is a public solar power charging station for use in mutual aid projects.  The system consists of a large lead acid battery(the same kind as a car battery but smaller), a 20 Watt solar panel, and charging accessories.  The charging accessories includes a charger which can be used to charge mobile devices off of USB.  If the station also includes standard power cords from USB A to USB C and the Apple charger, this station can be used even at night to charge up 4 devices at a time.

It requires some skill to use.  We need to train people to understand the battery cycle, how to charge and discharge it, and how to monitor voltage of both panel and battery.  We also combine this with skeletron to suspend the panel and move it over the course of the day to point directly at the sun using only the trash ties for adjustment.  

There is also some assembly required.  On the 12 volt to USB converter we need to cut off he alligator clips and solder on a barrel power connector, then use tape to insulate and strain relieve it. 
 
The whole system costs $120-$150.  The cables and charger all go in a bag.  Drill holes in the frame of the solar panel and create carrying strap and suspension tie with 6 foot clothesline trash ties.  Use duct tape and cardboard to make shock absorbers around the frame sides.  Use duct tape and more trash ties to create carrying and suspension ties for the battery.
