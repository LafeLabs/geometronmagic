# Webpage 
 
Signs can have a URL which points to the place where the sign is.  Sign carries a feed of coins.  URL has a geometron feed with a list of links which replicate the whole set.  Coins can be used to replicate any set of symbols.  Web page replicates itself, coins assuming you have robot, and connects with the robot operator via social media links.

# Flags

Flags are are physical hyperlinks to web pages, which carry the TRASH ROBOT brand.  Block letters are cut out of felt and sewn onto a square of black cotton flannel 28-40 inches on a side, with hem sewn and then cut to take trash ties to tie to skeletron for hanging/flying on display.  Use rainbow colored felt.  

A flag links to a web page. A web page has a list of links, which include pointing to the physical places where the coins are distributed.  Coins also point to the web page.  Cardboard signs point to the web page, and can carry coins.
