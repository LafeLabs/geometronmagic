# Geometron Magic

The [TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org) network exists to grow a new civilization from the trash of the old one.  When all the elements of a good life are contained in media we can replicate freely from trash and things we can grow we call that [TRASH MAGIC](https://www.trashrobot.org/user.php?scroll=scrolls/trashmagicbooks).  

The language of GEOMETRON is based on the symmetries of the Universe, and can be used to create geometric constructions to build up all our media and technology.  Geometron is described in the [First Book of Geometron](https://www.trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/) and [The Book of Geometron Magic](https://www.trashrobot.org/geometronmagic/).  

Digital media are hosted on Geometron hosts from the self-replicating code swarm (called cyber magic) at [github.com/lafelabs/geometronmagic](https://github.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic).  These can be installed on Raspberry Pi, any Linux machine, Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android.  See instructions below to install a Geometron server.  

Geometron Magic refers to self-replicating geometric media.  This is media based on geometric constructions using the language of Geometron to make things which people replicate freely.  

All work presented here was created by TRASH ROBOT, AKA Lafe Spietz, and is released into [Public Domain](https://github.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic/blob/main/LICENSE).  We replicate all this media and share it freely.  As our story gathers more attention, we will ask for sponsors to directly support the growth of the Trash Robot Network by both financial support and direct material support of creators on the Network.  This can be branded sponsorships, events, classes, sold art pieces, seminars, art installations, popups, games, educational programs, commissions, network installations, promotional campaigns, political campaigns, community organizing projects, or any other form of information sharing which has value to a potential sponsor.  Direct material support can include places to work and live, food, medicine, clean water and sanitation, transportation, employment with a sponsor or just cash donations.  

There is not central organizing body. To become a creator on the Network, just start creating and sharing.  Build things, share them, tell people about them, improve them.  


## Cube

The primary construction of the Trash Robot network is the Cube. It is a 4 inch cube with 5 sides, each side is 3 layers of corrugated cardboard.  All sides are made from 4 inch squares. Cut cardboard trash with a laser cutter or box cutter or razor blade or build and operate stamps for automated production.  These cubes form a physical social media network, where we print media onto them, build them into machines, and use them to grow living things which are of use in building our new world.

The following Geometron file has the layout of all three of the panel patterns to make a cube.  To make one cube you need 6 each of the two patterns with twofold symmetry and 3 of the pattern with 4 fold symmetry.  All are 4 inches by 4 inches.  You can use this file to cut these out on a laser cutter.  Or you can download it and upload it to a Geometron server and make your own variations, including custom laser etch patterns.  To replicate one by hand using the Geometron ruler, note that all patterns are on a grid of 0.5 inches and just slide the ruler around to get the patterns which match the diagram.

The box is self-replicating if it contains a box cutter.  Squares and all the panel cutouts can be created with direct trace and a box cutter from existing parts, or new patterns can be created with a Geometron ruler(see below).  Find a cardboard recycle dumpster, take boxes out, slice out flat panels, cut out into 4 inch squares, then either cut out and stack/glue or stack/glue then cut out.  Assemble, and glue or rubber band as needed, use for parts bins, guerilla organic growing projects(plants, fungus, worms, compost), structural elements, decorative elements, and components of the Geometron Icon printer(see below)

# Geometron Ruler

The Geometron Ruler is one inch by six inches. One side has tenths and the other halves, quarters and eights. The highest quality rulers are made from quarter inch neon green acrylic with a laser cutter.  Any ruler can be used to make more rulers.  Cereal box cardboard is a good material.  Find a maker space or individual with a laser cutter.  Dig through the waste bin to find extra acrylic.  Place the outlines and etch and make rulers.  Give them away and spread the word of Geometron, Trash Magic, Trash Robot and so on.  Also you can use [Ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com/) to get large numbers of rulers made and can sell those if you so choose.  

Using Ponoko.com is only cost effective if you have a budget of over 1000 dollars, then the cost per ruler can drop to about a dollar and a half.  Also, Ponoko only has eighth inch acrylic and quarter inch is the nicest.  For best results, go find 0.2 inch or quarter inch neon green acrylic somewhere, find a laser cutter and print these out yourself.  All the files for this are below.  

This is some 6 inch rulers from both green and yellow acrylic and a 15 cm metric ruler.

# Shape Set
 
The basic set of Geometron shapes can be used in conjunction with the rulers above to construct objects using Geometron which mirror the constructions in the web browser.  

These can be laser cut or printed and cut out or constructed through any of various geometric means. The shape set is a set of shapes based on a three inch unit and the various natural scales implied by common symmetries of the Universe.  For best results, use 1/8 inch neon green transparent acrylic.
