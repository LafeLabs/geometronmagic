# Geometron Magic

The [TRASH ROBOT](https://www.trashrobot.org) network exists to grow a new civilization from the trash of the old one.  When all the elements of a good life are contained in media we can replicate freely from trash and things we can grow we call that [TRASH MAGIC](https://www.trashrobot.org/user.php?scroll=scrolls/trashmagicbooks).  

The language of GEOMETRON is based on the symmetries of the Universe, and can be used to create geometric constructions to build up all our media and technology.  Geometron is described in the [First Book of Geometron](https://www.trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/) and [The Book of Geometron Magic](https://www.trashrobot.org/geometronmagic/).  

Digital media are hosted on Geometron hosts from the self-replicating code swarm (called cyber magic) at [github.com/lafelabs/geometronmagic](https://github.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic).  These can be installed on Raspberry Pi, any Linux machine, Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android.  See instructions below to install a Geometron server.  

Geometron Magic refers to self-replicating geometric media.  This is media based on geometric constructions using the language of Geometron to make things which people replicate freely.  

All work presented here was created by TRASH ROBOT, AKA Lafe Spietz, and is released into [Public Domain](https://github.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic/blob/main/LICENSE).  We replicate all this media and share it freely.  As our story gathers more attention, we will ask for sponsors to directly support the growth of the Trash Robot Network by both financial support and direct material support of creators on the Network.  This can be branded sponsorships, events, classes, sold art pieces, seminars, art installations, popups, games, educational programs, commissions, network installations, promotional campaigns, political campaigns, community organizing projects, or any other form of information sharing which has value to a potential sponsor.  Direct material support can include places to work and live, food, medicine, clean water and sanitation, transportation, employment with a sponsor or just cash donations.  

There is no central organizing body. To become a creator on the Network, just start creating and sharing.  To become a sponsor, find a creator, ask them what they need, and support them.  Build things, share them, tell people about them, improve them.  

We are content creators who create our own platform.  We create physical media as well as physical infrastructure to host digital media, and content to spread on that media.  We create physical media which has material value in the form of food and consumer products as well as digital media which has value in capturing attention.  Creators create, sponsors support, and consumers consume. This is the path of our media, and it removes the digital landlords who currently own all media networks.

## Cube

The primary construction of the Trash Robot network is the Cube. It is a 4 inch cube with 5 sides, each side is 3 layers of corrugated cardboard.  All sides are made from 4 inch squares. Cut cardboard trash with a laser cutter or box cutter or razor blade or build and operate stamps for automated production.  These cubes form a physical social media network, where we print media onto them, build them into machines, and use them to grow living things which are of use in building our new world.

The following Geometron file has the layout of all three of the panel patterns to make a cube.  To make one cube you need 6 each of the two patterns with twofold symmetry and 3 of the pattern with 4 fold symmetry.  All are 4 inches by 4 inches.  You can use this file to cut these out on a laser cutter.  Or you can download it and upload it to a Geometron server and make your own variations, including custom laser etch patterns.  To replicate one by hand using the Geometron ruler, note that all patterns are on a grid of 0.5 inches and just slide the ruler around to get the patterns which match the diagram.  

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic/main/cube/symbolfeed/cube.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic/main/cube/symbolfeed/cube.svg)

The box is self-replicating if it contains a box cutter.  Squares and all the panel cutouts can be created with direct trace and a box cutter from existing parts, or new patterns can be created with a Geometron ruler(see below).  Find a cardboard recycle dumpster, take boxes out, slice out flat panels, cut out into 4 inch squares, then either cut out and stack/glue or stack/glue then cut out.  Assemble, and glue or rubber band as needed, use for parts bins, guerilla organic growing projects(plants, fungus, worms, compost), structural elements, decorative elements, and components of the Geometron Icon printer(see below)

# Geometron Ruler

The Geometron Ruler is one inch by six inches. One side has tenths and the other halves, quarters and eights. The highest quality rulers are made from quarter inch neon green acrylic with a laser cutter.  Any ruler can be used to make more rulers.  Cereal box cardboard is a good material.  Find a maker space or individual with a laser cutter.  Dig through the waste bin to find extra acrylic.  Place the outlines and etch and make rulers.  Give them away and spread the word of Geometron, Trash Magic, Trash Robot and so on.  Also you can use [Ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com/) to get large numbers of rulers made and can sell those if you so choose.  

Using Ponoko.com is only cost effective if you have a budget of over 1000 dollars, then the cost per ruler can drop to about a dollar and a half.  Also, Ponoko only has eighth inch acrylic and quarter inch is the nicest.  For best results, go find 0.2 inch or quarter inch neon green acrylic somewhere, find a laser cutter and print these out yourself.  All the files for this are below.  

This is some 6 inch rulers from both green and yellow acrylic and a 15 cm metric ruler.

# Shape Set
 
The basic set of Geometron shapes can be used in conjunction with the rulers above to construct objects using Geometron which mirror the constructions in the web browser.  

These can be laser cut or printed and cut out or constructed through any of various geometric means. The shape set is a set of shapes based on a three inch unit and the various natural scales implied by common symmetries of the Universe.  For best results, use 1/8 inch neon green transparent acrylic.

## Geometron Icon Printer 

The printer is made up of 3 cubes, each with a custom lid.  The top lid holds the z axis motion stage.  The middle lid has the control panel which controls the printer. The bottom lid is just a cover for the cube which holds the Arduino brain.  Each stage in the x and y directions is an independent construction with square base and top using a DVD drive stage.  All stages have 4 wire cables with 0.1 inch socket connectors which go to the Arduino brain.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic/main/cube/uploadimages/printer-photo.jpg)

### Z axis stage Cube

The Z axis stage is made by gluing a 3 inch square in the center of a 4 inch square then building up levels of cardboard to the stage, and a stack of cardboard on the stage which can hold the Sproing, also shown here.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic/main/cube/uploadimages/z-cube.jpg)
 

Don't forget the rocks! Without rocks, this will instantly tip over.  Rocks are essential. Choose nice rocks so you can carry them around and use them for other stuff.  

### Sproing 

This soft spring loaded tool holder is the magic that makes this printer work on uneven random surfaces.  By being soft, a long travel distance makes it possible to make marks over uneven surfaces.  This is made from stiffer thicker plastic, thin soft sheet from milk bottles, duct tape and rubber bands. It uses the standard Geometron Rulers described in the [laser shapes scroll](scrolls/lasershapes).
 
This component is called the Sproing.

HDPE sheet from milk bottle is cut out into 2 identical rectangles, each 4.5 inches by 0.6 inches. Lines for folds are drawn an inch and a quarter in from each end.

Cut and fold

Z folds. About 90 degrees for each fold.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZGw7M94.jpg) 

Get some stiff and thick but not too brittle plastic like polypropylene from the lid of a plastic storage tote.  Trace out with Geometron ruler 2 different rectangles, one is 3 inches by 0.6 inches and the other 3 by three quarters of an inch.

Cut out rectangles with box cutter.

Join it all up witch duct tape as shown:

![](https://i.imgur.com/aot16bk.jpg)

A doubled up small rubber band is used to mount the pen.

![](https://i.imgur.com/40jY0VL.jpg)

And finally the Sproing is fastened to the z stage on the DVD drive using another doubled up rubber band.  Stack of cardboard is built onto the stage, first with 2 part epoxy Gorilla Glue to connect the metal to the cardboard then with Elmer's glue for the subsequent layers of cardboard to cardboard, and build that up until it's a good stage for the Sproing with the pen or other tool.

To create the Controller cube lid use the following patterns for the 4 inch outside square and 3 inch inside square.  These patterns can be printed on a laser cutter to get all the labels right and the holes and cuts.  Or they can be created using the Geometron ruler and shape set and a pen by hand.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/geometronmagic/main/cube/uploadimages/brain-box-back.jpg)

The piece on the inside of the lid is 0.5 inches by 3 inches and centered.  The cutout in the back/base is 1 inch wide and 1.125 inches high.  This can be cut by hand or laser cut from a bottom board.

The two bases can be just made from stacks of small cardboard cutouts cut by hand and big 4 inch square on top and bottom, or similar sized rectangular cutouts.  These can be changed in orientation to control what angle of viewer can see the print as it comes out when printing in different spaces and configurations.
