# trashfeed
 
This is a place where trash is left. It is a place we can drop trash media to share and it will blend in and can be hidden.  Maps link to scrolls which link to ... anything! ideas, places, more maps, more scrolls, machines, people, actions materials, any form of media, anything we can imagine can be linked with this media.  

The game of CHAOS consists of creating layers of information over the physical world with this system of media, which builds imaginary worlds for us to live in.
