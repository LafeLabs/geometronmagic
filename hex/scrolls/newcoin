# Create New Icons

Find the symbol/image/icon you want to trace, a url of some image somewhere either on the Internet or your local server.  Go to the [global image feed](globalimagefeed.html) and copy/paste the url of the image into the input(use right clicking to get an image url).

Click the "ALIGN" link to go to the image aligner.  Move the image around by dragging it.  Use the buttons and sliders to scale and rotate the image.  Hit the "SAVE" button to save the state of the alignment.

Click "TRACE" to go to the icon tracer page.  To clear the glyph hit the vertical line key "|".  To move with a pixel drawn, use keys a, s, d, and f.  To move without drawing a pixel use the keys z, x, c,  and v.   Hit "enter" to switch between pixel draw mode and text mode, in which you can type and it will create letters using the Geometron pixel font(this is documented in the [First Book of Geometron](http://trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/)).  Arrow keys step through the Geometron glyph, allowing for it to be edited at any point in the program.  Actions are deleted using the backspace key.  Color is selected by selecting the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.  The backtick key "`" selects the default color black again.  All of these can also be accessed by way of the touch screen keys in the other panel in the display.  Hit the SAVE button whenever a glyph is ready to be saved to the feed.

Icon sets can be copied, manipulated, added to or subtracted from, or traded. They can be printed on paper, trash, leaves, bark, wood, plastic, metal, stone, 3d printed plastic, clay, anything you can cut with a laser cutter, or canvas or svg elements in HTML.  

Once you have finished the design of an icon, you can print it by clicking the link to "PROGRAM CLAY PRINTER".  Note the icon you want to print and click on it.  When you do that the code in the rectangular text area in the lower right hand corner of the screen will change to have the correct robot motion sequence. This sequence is just a long string of letters representing robot movements.

After you have the Arduino program for the icon you want to print loaded in the browser, install the Arduino IDE, downloaded from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or click the "DOWNLOAD" link on the Arduino program page.  

Connect the robot to the USB port of your laptop.  Test all 6 motions of the robot on the controller: up, down, left, right, forward, back.  

Open the Arduino IDE, select Arduino UNO for the board type, then select a port which appears in the list of ports, and if it doesn't work try other ones at random until one does.  Then copy/paste the Arduino code from the window in the browser into the IDE and save the file as whatever the default file name is(we'll always replace it so these are disposable).   Upload to the board.

## [follow instructions to create prints and put them in EARTH BAG](scrolls/earthbag)


Sculpey polymer clay: get as much as you can. Roll into a sausage then separate into balls, and roll those round about an inch in diameter.

Squash between laser cut shapes to make flat on both sides:

Position in the printer:

Position the tool over the center of the coin, just a little bit up from the surface and hit the green go button on the controller. 

Program the robot by copy/pasting code from the programmer to the Arduino. [See instructions for creating new coins here](scrolls/newcoin).  

The robot prints:

Keep printing until you have built up a whole symbolic language specific to whatever you are doing. This is a [generalized philosophical language, as envisioned by Leibniz](http://trashrobot.org/geometronmagic/).  

Coins must be baked in a conventional oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes, then allowed to fully cool for some time before they are hard.

When you have a bunch of these, put them in an Earth Bag.  

Once this is ready to make a bunch of stamps, go on to the [FIRE BAG](scrolls/firebag) to make stamps, collect them, distribute them and use them to print the final coins which go in the [WATER BAG](scrolls/waterbag)
