Handle construction: stack of cardboard:

Handle goes through a slot cut in the top board

Top board layout:

Base board is a stack of big slabs of cardboard, rulers shown for scale, punch holes in corners and thread clotheslines through. Clotheslines are 6 foot segments with ends taped with duct tape.

We make fasteners with 3 inch triangles and chains of rubber bands:

These are used as bunji cords across the base board:

The L is strapped to the X stage with a pair of rubber bands

And the Y stage is fixed into place against the upright of the L with another rubber band, with the wires looped up and around and through the rubber and for strain relief.
 
Figure out which is X(red), Y(green) and Z(blue), do a couple test prints to make sure you have the right orientation, and use paint pen to to mark which is which on the brain.

Be sure that you have a red tape or paint pen marker to mark the side of the controller which goes away from where the USB is.

## controller

Controller kit:

- 26 inches of 9 conductor ribbon cable from red to black colors
- 8 buttons, Panasonic part number EVQ-11L05R
- 9 pin female header with long pins, created by hand from 10 pin using a knife
- push pin to punch holes in the board for the buttons
- 7 solid wire jumpers, 3" long
- Geometron shapes: 3" equillateral triangle, 3" square, 3" isoscoles right triangle, 6"x1" ruler with Geometron markings

Corrugated Cardboard patterns

![](https://i.imgur.com/bBO9jAm.jpg)

Wrap board in black duct tape, punch holes spaced by 0.2 inches from each other, centered around the 8 marked dots from the above diagram.  Insert buttons on top side, bend leads. Connect jumpers so one pin of each button is connected to all the other ground pins, which connect to black wire on ribbon cable, which is grounded at the Arduino side.  Red to the right, black to the ground/left, wires are in order by color code and match the pins as numbered above, in order.  Split the ribbon cable by 7 inches on this end, strip ends.  duct tape with black duct tape the first non-split inch onto the 1 inch square at the top middle of the controller board as shown.

Buttons are made as shown by wrapping color coded duct tape.  Green circle is "run" red octagon is "stop", red triangles are x motion, green triangles are y motion, and blue triangles are z motion.  After buttons are constructed, gently rest them in place, then duct tape loose strips on edges in color of buttons, then run black duct tape over them to hold them in place better and also keep the background all-black outside the button areas.

Finish opposite end of cable by cutting out two corrugated cardboard strain relief boot parts as shown, separating wires for 1 inch, stripping the ends, soldering them to the 9 pin female header, then packaging the whole assembly with black duct tape, sandwiching the soldered pins between the two strain relief boot cutouts.  Finally, paint pens are used to color code the *direction* of the pin progression, from red to purple.  This orientation of the rainbow color progression must be the same as on the Arduino, and it is what people will use to identify which orientation to plug that connector in with.

## Tools

- soldering iron, solder
- pliers to break headers
- volt meter
- tiny flat head screwdriver
- wire cutters

## Assembly of board

![](https://i.imgur.com/kCN9pMG.jpg)

Jumper connects Vcc to Vpower (for standard USB powered printer robot).  After this is soldered, trip excess on bottom of board

Be sure to solder all of the vertical headers before the right angle header so there is no interference. Be careful to split the headers that come with the motor controller boards so that they split in exactly the right place.  Be sure to also solder all the joints on the bottom side of the headers that support the stepper driver boards. 

Note also the orientation of the board and that the pin labels between the main board and the Pololu boards match.

## Adjust potentiometers for current control

![](https://i.imgur.com/XMMaNqx.jpg)


Connect the USB to power using a [USB A to B printer cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UNZ9HLU/) and carefully rotate with tiny screw driver all the way counter clockwise, testing the voltage to see that it is 0.1 V.  Note that there is minimal resistance to over-rotating, be very careful not to over-rotate.  This can be adjusted by feel without a volt meter but is easier to do with a meter.  Note the test point on the board as the positive side, and connect the meter to one of the ground points on the main board. 

## Assemble enclosure

Mount completed board on Arduino UNO.  

Replicate the pattern as shown from thin cardboard to use to cut out in thick corrugated cardboard.

Use rainbow duct tape and googly eyes to complete enclosure as shown.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HwXfmp8.jpg)

Note that the orientation of the rainbow matters!! red is at the same end as red in the ribbon cable, so the colors indicate the correct orientation of the connector for the controller(which has to also be [correctly assembled](scrolls/controller) according to the colors shown in that scroll).
