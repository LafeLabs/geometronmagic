# Sproing

This soft spring loaded tool holder is the magic that makes this printer work on uneven random surfaces.  By being soft, a long travel distance makes it possible to make marks over uneven surfaces.  This is made from stiffer thicker plastic, thin soft sheet from milk bottles, duct tape and rubber bands. It uses the standard Geometron Rulers described in the [laser shapes scroll](scrolls/lasershapes).
 
This component is called the Sproing.

HDPE sheet from milk bottle is cut out into 2 identical rectangles, each 4.5 inches by 0.6 inches. Lines for folds are drawn an inch and a quarter in from each end.

Z folds. About 90 degrees for each fold.

Get some stiff and thick but not too brittle plastic like polypropylene from the lid of a plastic storage tote.  Trace out with Geometron ruler 2 different rectangles, one is 3 inches by 0.6 inches and the other 3 by three quarters of an inch.

A doubled up small rubber band is used to mount the pen.

And finally the Sproing is fastened to the z stage on the DVD drive using another doubled up rubber band.  Stack of cardboard is built onto the stage, first with 2 part epoxy Gorilla Glue to connect the metal to the cardboard then with Elmer's glue for the subsequent layers of cardboard to cardboard, and build that up until it's a good stage for the Sproing with the pen or other tool.
