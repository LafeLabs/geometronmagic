# Trash Magic 

## *A universal philosophical language.*

We have the intention to build Trash Magic, a world we in which we will build everything from trash, and build a culture which freely replicates everything we build.  

We express our intentions in sets of things.  We represent these things with symbols which both represent the thing and point to the thing. These symbols are expressed using the geometric language Geometron, which can then be imprinted in any media: pixels on a screen, plastic, wood, paper, metal, 3d printing, laser cutters, electron beam lithography, or any other process or material.  

We use the expression of sets of things to communicate our will to replicate to other people.  If we can replicate our desire to replicate, the set itself will replicate. If we can make sets which replicate, we can use this to express our intent to create full Trash Magic. 

To cast trash magic, we think of what we want, turn that into sets of things, then create self-replicating Geometron code in a web browser to represent that set.  This is then expressed in physical media printed on trash with a robot built from trash which we release into the physical world from which we got the trash.  We can take trash out of an actual trash can and convert it into media which we distribute freely.  

The network can be supported by sponsors whose media we print.  A sponsor can direct us to a pile of trash and give us a glyph and a space to distribute and we go and run the robots.  The system runs on solar energy so it can be off grid.
