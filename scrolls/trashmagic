# Trash Magic 

## *[A universal philosophical language.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis)*

1. Consider a thing we wish to replicate
2. Break that thing up conceptually into a set of things
3. Represent each of those things with a Geometron Icon
4. Replicate media with those icons into trash using machines made from trash

We first state our purpose, which is to create a world where all our technology consists of self-replicating constructions from trash.  Then we create Trash Magic to fulfill that purpose.  Trash Magic is this self-replicating purpose.  We say "I want to build this", and then create media the primary purpose of which is to guide other people to also want to build this.  Then, in order to actually create self-replicating technology from trash we start with media.  We build media using a combination of the Raspberry Pi, the Arduino, off the shelf electronics, and trash.  We use this to create printers made out of trash.  

We apply trash magic first and foremost to itself: we create sets of things which replicate the trash robots which print on trash as well as the system for people to learn how to operate them and to process trash into media which contains the icons which represent the set and so on.  This is a highly recursive system of information, where all the physical things have links to self-replicating media which replicates all the physical things, and all the digital things have links which guide people to replicate the entire system as well.  Set replication includes both digital replication(of web documents) and physical replication(of physical media, clothes, shelters, technology of all kind, and printers which print in trash).

We use the Geometron language and Geometron Magic system as our information architecture which supports Trash Magic.  These are documented in the [First Book of Geometron](https://www.trashrobot.org/bookofgeometronfirst/) and [Geometron Magic](https://www.trashrobot.org/geometronmagic/), both of which are free to read online as well as sold by print on demand press Lulu. 

As we prove our ability to replicate and evolve the system, we can guide it organically toward our intentions, creating more and more complex systems of self-replicating things from trash until we build the whole system: clean water, sanitation, heating and cooling, medicine production, medical imaging, food production and preparation, and so on and so on, all the elements of a good life with enough resiliency to thrive in the coming global changes.  

We can build this! But it starts with just copying the trash robot and using it to print out stuff on trash, then giving it all away to get more people to copy it and so on. 

The things we make and give away are not property, we do not own them and neither does anyone else, their value comes from passing them on and/or using them. Trash is media.  Trash is used to transmit information, materials, and energy through social networks.  We turn trash into art, and *pass it along to flow freely*.
