# Flags

Flags are are physical hyperlinks to web pages, which carry the TRASH ROBOT brand.  Block letters are cut out of felt and sewn onto a square of black cotton flannel 28-40 inches on a side, with hem sewn and then cut to take trash ties to tie to skeletron for hanging/flying on display.  Use rainbow colored felt.  

A flag links to a web page. A web page has a list of links, which include pointing to the physical places where the coins are distributed.  Coins also point to the web page.  Cardboard signs point to the web page, and can carry coins.
