 - artbox self-replicating cardboard box
 - icon link feed, top page of geometron magic
 - skeletron and the rest of Action Geometry
 - the first book of geometron as a scroll set, integrated into this living geometron system
 - the book Geometron Magic as a scroll set
 - link to buy the hard copy of the first book of Geometron on lulu press
 - link to buy the Geometron Magic from lulu press
 - the pdf to print the book geometron magic on letter size paper yourself to put in a 3 ring binder
 - roctal printing system for encoding geometron onto physical objects
 - self-replicating roctal code, where a stamp is used to make many prints of a roctal sequence which is geometron code
 - roctal geometron code can be html, json, php, markdown, arduino, or any of the things which fit inside those formats(like base 64 encoded bitmaps)
 - roctal geometron hypercube
 - circuits which directly convert roctal geometron bytecode into robot movements
 - close that loop, so the circuit drives the robot to print the circuit
 - this is only magic if it replicates, make it magic, this magic is an element of the set
 - the printer and scanner of roctal using dvd drives with micro positioning
 - geometron magic, the concept
 - pi crust media distribution system
 - maps of places using geometron maps
 - geometron maps as a chaotic powerpoint
 - geometron maps as memes
 - geometron maps as locators of things in space
 - geometron maps as annotations of technology images
 - geometron maps for immersive gaming
 - cyber magic, the general phenomenon of self-replicating code sets
