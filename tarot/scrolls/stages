This documents the assembly of the main mechanical elements of the xyz trash robot printer. This prints with a magic marker on bits of trash.  This assembly process assumes that cables are already attached to the DVD drives.  This is its own step. Also it is separate from the Brain and the Controller and the Trash Frame which it sits in, as well as the icon design process.

Use 2 part epoxy Gorilla glue and Elmer's school glue:

All joints between metal or plastic and cardboard are with the epoxy.  The joints between layers of cardboard and each other are Elmer's glue.  Build up layers.  Be sure to create space for the parts to move freely.

Z axis stage.  Notice the blue color code on the connector, which orients the connector as well to a matching paint marking on the [brain](scrolls/brain) board.

Large area stage for top layer matches the size exactly of the base of the L bracket.

Note we use green color code for the y cable, red for x and blue for z.

Mount the xy stage on the [Trash Frame](scrolls/trashframe) using a rubber band [trash tie](scrolls/trashtie):
