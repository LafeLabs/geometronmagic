# why
 
 - self replicating media
 - the media replicates the whole system, including machines
 - this makes it self replicating machines
 - these machines consume trash
 - this makes them self-replicating trash-consuming machines
 - the media documents how to replicate the machines, and those documents are edited in real time as the system replicates
 - this makes it possible for everyone replicating the system to *evolve* it with intention
